    <h3 style="color: #0C3C60">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe look to provide an in-depth website for our users that is a step above other data visualistic
        websites on the market. Through our website, coaches and players will have a login feature. Though the website will be similar for both, they will have different dashboards.
        For coaches, they will have the ability to enter data from each game their team plays and connect different statistics to players on their team. They will also have the ability
        to view data visualization graphs that relate to the players on their team.
